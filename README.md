This program allows lawyers to click on a folder using a GUI, and the code will recursively 
read all the folder's filenames and filepaths (using depth first search) to create a 
Microsoft Word document with a table that allows them to start reviewing documents
for corporate due dilligence.  Beforehand, legal interns were copying and pasting
file and sub-folder names manually.
